# Conway's Game of Life

I have always been fascinated by the concept of cellular automata, and Conway's Game of Life is one of the most well-known examples. The rules are simple:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

I applied these rules to a 2D grid of cells, and the results were fascinating. The patterns that emerged were often unpredictable, and I was amazed by the complexity that could arise from such simple rules.
